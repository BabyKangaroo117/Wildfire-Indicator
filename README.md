# Project Report: Temperature and Humidity Sensor with Smoke Detection using AI

## 1. Project Goals
The main objective of this project is to develop a system that reads temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor, processes it on a local machine, and integrates this data with a smoke detection model trained using a pre-trained neural network (AlexNet). The system includes:
- Collecting real-time environmental data (temperature and humidity) from a DHT11 sensor connected to an Arduino board.
- Transmitting the data to a Python script on the host machine.
- Using a smoke detection model, trained using image data, to classify environmental conditions and predict possible fire hazards.

## 2. Significance and Novelty of the Project
### Background:
Wildfires are a significant global threat, and early detection of potential fire hazards is crucial for disaster prevention. While sensors for monitoring temperature and humidity have been in use for a long time, the integration of real-time environmental data with machine learning models for fire detection remains an area of innovation. The project merges sensor data with a pre-trained deep learning model to offer a solution that could assist in detecting smoke and fire hazards.

### Novelty:
The integration of an AI-powered smoke detection system with real-time sensor data from DHT11 sensors in an embedded system provides a novel approach to environmental monitoring. The use of AlexNet, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, to classify smoke and fire conditions based on image data enhances the capabilities of simple environmental sensors, offering a comprehensive solution for early wildfire detection.

## 7. Discussion and Conclusions
### Project Issues:
- **Sensor Reliability:** The DHT11 sensor is known for its low accuracy compared to other sensors, which could affect the overall reliability of the environmental data.
- **Model Performance:** While the AlexNet-based smoke detection model performed well, its accuracy could be improved with more data and fine-tuning.
- **Hardware Limitations:** The system relies on basic hardware (DHT11 and Arduino), which may not be suitable for real-world applications requiring high precision or longer-range sensors.

### Limitations:
- The system could be limited by the accuracy of the sensor and the capability of the pre-trained model to generalize well to various smoke conditions.
- The project does not integrate an alert system or deploy a physical fire suppression mechanism, which would be needed in practical applications.

### Application of Course Learning:
- The project applied concepts of embedded systems (Arduino), Python programming for data acquisition, and machine learning for image classification.
- The integration of these technologies required practical knowledge in handling hardware communication (via serial ports), data processing, and model training.

### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the potential for integrating environmental sensors and machine learning models to create smarter, more proactive systems for fire hazard detection. Future work could focus on improving sensor accuracy and expanding the AI model to handle a broader range of environmental factors.
